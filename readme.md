# Color Match Challenge 🎨

**Color Match Challenge** is a fast-paced arcade game where you control a platform to catch falling colored blocks. Only blocks that **match the platform’s color** earn points — any mismatch ends the game!

- Watch the platform color — it changes every level!
- Use arrow keys to move left and right.
- Survive as long as possible and climb the levels.
